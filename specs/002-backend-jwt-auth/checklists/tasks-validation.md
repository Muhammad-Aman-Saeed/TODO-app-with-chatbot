# Tasks Validation Checklist: Backend JWT Authentication Implementation

## Phase Completion
- [x] Phase 1: Setup tasks created
- [x] Phase 2: Foundational components tasks created
- [x] Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks created with [US1] labels
- [x] Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks created with [US2] labels
- [x] Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks created with [US3] labels
- [x] Phase 6: User Story 4 tasks created with [US4] labels
- [x] Phase 7: Polish & production hardening tasks created

## Task Format Validation
- [x] All tasks follow the format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [US#?] Description with file path`
- [x] All tasks have proper checkboxes
- [x] All tasks have sequential Task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
- [x] Parallel tasks marked with [P] flag
- [x] User story tasks marked with [US#] labels
- [x] All tasks include specific file paths

## Content Completeness
- [x] Setup phase includes project initialization tasks
- [x] Foundational phase includes all required components (main.py, db.py, models.py, etc.)
- [x] Each user story has its own phase with appropriate tasks
- [x] All required API endpoints are covered
- [x] JWT authentication and validation tasks included
- [x] User isolation and ownership validation tasks included
- [x] Error handling tasks included
- [x] Production hardening tasks included

## User Story Alignment
- [x] User Story 1 (Secure Task Management) tasks mapped correctly
- [x] User Story 2 (JWT Token Validation) tasks mapped correctly
- [x] User Story 3 (CRUD Operations) tasks mapped correctly
- [x] User Story 4 (Filtering and Sorting) tasks mapped correctly
- [x] Acceptance scenarios addressed in tasks
- [x] Independent test criteria considered

## Dependencies and Order
- [x] Dependencies between phases properly considered
- [x] Foundational components completed before user stories
- [x] User story priorities reflected in task order
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities identified
